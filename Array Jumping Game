Array Jumping Game
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 1 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


You are given the following array of integers:

6,10,2,7,0,0,0,2,9,0

Each element in the array represents your MAXIMUM jump length at that position. This means that if you are at position i and your maximum jump length is n, you can jump to any position from i to i+n.

Assuming you are initially positioned at the start of the array, determine whether you are able to reach the last index.

Your answer should be submitted as 1 or 0, representing true and false respectively
