Array Jumping Game
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 1 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


You are given the following array of integers:

6,10,2,7,0,0,0,2,9,0

Each element in the array represents your MAXIMUM jump length at that position. This means that if you are at position i and your maximum jump length is n, you can jump to any position from i to i+n.

Assuming you are initially positioned at the start of the array, determine whether you are able to reach the last index.

Your answer should be submitted as 1 or 0, representing true and false respectively

function arrayJump(arr)
{
	let n = arr.length;
    let jumps = Array.from({length: n}, (_, i) => 0);
    let min;
    jumps[n - 1] = 0;
    for (i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (arr[i] == 0)
            jumps[i] = Number.MAX_VALUE;
        else if (arr[i] >= n - i - 1)
            jumps[i] = 1;
        else {
            min = Number.MAX_VALUE;
            for (j = i + 1; j < n && j <= arr[i] + i; j++) {
                if (min > jumps[j])
                    min = jumps[j];
            }
            if (min != Number.MAX_VALUE)
                jumps[i] = min + 1;
            else
                jumps[i] = min;
        }
    }
    return jumps[0];
}
arrayJump(arr) < Number.MAX_VALUE ?  1: 0;
